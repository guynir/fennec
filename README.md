===========

Client-side (Javascript) library that prolificates the work with templating frameworks.

##Table of contents
* [Before anything else](#before-anything-else)
* [Background](#background)

##Before anything else
Before you even think of skipping to the [Background](#background) section (which is, by the way, pretty much empty),
please read this openning statement:

Just like [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) introduced us a new way of "how to manipulate the DOM", and
[backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) taught us how we should really model our business and interconnect with the server,
much like [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/), bravely led us to render contents on the client side, this project
(the _Fennec_ project - of course), is trying to bring HTML/Javascript developers to use some good practices when it comes to dynamic content
generation on client side.

In general, the _Fennec_ library is a short .js file. It's main contribution comes from the practices it introduces.

Now you can ready the [Background](#background) section.

##Background

I will shortly introduce this section. I promise.
